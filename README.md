# What is Starsdraw Pirates ?

Basically, Starsdraw is a lottery using NFT from the Stargaze blockchain and regularly distributing STARS token rewards.

To participate, a player must have at least one Pirate on his wallet. The number of draws and the reward amount will vary depending on Stargaze APR.

# Selection of the lottery winners

The drawing is made using an algorithm whose variables are public and obtained by making the transaction to retrieve the pending rewards on the lottery address. To make sure that there is no rigging in the selection of the winners, you can use the scripts provided in this git repository to check the results.
